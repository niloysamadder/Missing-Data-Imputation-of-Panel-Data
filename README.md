This project aims to impute the missing data points of a panel dataset. The major tasks of this project includes:
1. Identifying the proportion and pattern of missing data
2. Determining the type of missingness
3. Applying Multiple Imputation by four different algorithms of Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE): Predictive Mean Matching (pmm), Classification and Regression Trees (cart), Random Forests (rf), Bayesian Linear Regression (norm)
4. Finding out the most suitable algorithm
